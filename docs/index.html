            <h1 class="text-6xl p-4">I'd like to begin<br> with a story....</h1>

            <p class="p-4"><span class="text-2xl">There was once a woman who was very capable, smart and witty, who knew
                    she
                    had so much to offer the world. She was passionate about the arts, education and
                    justice. She knew she could make a difference somewhere and wanted to empower
                    people to reach their potential.</span></p>

            <p class="p-4">The irony was she really struggled to accept her own
                potential... to truly believe in herself and her abilities. Years went by taking jobs and
                striving to forge her career. She took many paths, sometimes retracing her steps,
                stopping at a crossroads for a break, picking herself up and starting again. This
                search took a number of years. Along the way were some great achievements. Yet
                she still didn't feel the sense of greatness and triumph deep down within.</p>

            <q class="float-right text-3xl w-48 ml-10 mb-10">Over time the woman began to feel alive with confidence</q>

            <p class="p-4">Then something happened... this woman went to work in a new role. The job was
                interesting. It brought together education, empowering others and making a
                difference to peoples' lives.... and the people she worked with were brilliant. The
                most brilliant of all was her manager. This person saw the woman. Saw her
                potential, believed in her and became her champion. Over time the woman became
                alive with confidence. She took on more work with the true belief she could do it...
                and she could do it well. People noticed her. She became an expert in her chosen
                field. People asked her advice. All the while her manager continued to support her
                and build her confidence.</p>
            <p class="p-4">How did the manager make such a huge difference to the woman's life? Did they
                have all the answers and keep feeding them to her? Did they take away things that
                were too difficult and make the woman's life easier? No, the manager coached the
                woman in a very subtle way. They asked incisive questions when the woman was
                at a crossroads; they encouraged the woman to explore her drivers and motivations,
                to identify her strengths and recognise her achievements for herself. The manager
                helped the woman to understand her limiting beliefs and vanquish them.</p>
            <p class="p-4">The woman's manager was a coach and used coaching skills to manage the team.</p>
            <p class="p-4">I am that woman. I understand the power of coaching and how it can change lives. I
                have now trained as a professional coach and I want to share the transformational
                wonder of coaching with you. You can be your best self and make changes... and
                you have the ability to do so within you already.</p>

                    <p class="p-4 text-indigo-50">My name is Catherine Fenn. My career has been an adventure. Starting out as a documentary
                        photographer and recently working in student support services within higher education, I've navigated diverse
                        landscapes and have worked with a wide range of people.</p>
                    <p class="p-4 text-indigo-50">My career has encompassed roles across all sectors, proving that life isn't a linear path;
                        it's a dynamic journey of change and adaptation. This breadth and depth of understanding sets me apart in my
                        coaching offer.</p>

                    <p class="p-4 text-indigo-50">Passionate about lifelong learning and committed to empowering individuals to unlock their
                        fullest potential, I firmly believe that each of us holds the ability to shape the lives we desire.</p>

                        community projects, continuously expanding my skill set while sharing my expertise. I love supporting people to get
                        to where they want and need to be.</p>

                        higher education students, as well as guiding adults in their personal and professional development. I bring my
                        creativity and strategic thinking to all the work I do.</p>

                        approach that embraces
                        the significance of introspection and self-discovery. This

                        <p class="p-4">Coaching is the process of helping you identify and overcome your personal and
                            professional challenges and achieve your desired outcomes. A coach will use deep
                            listening, some questions and short exercises to help you realise and overcome your
                            barriers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p-4">A coach is a thinking partner, who won't provide solutions but enable you to explore
                            possible solutions or paths yourself. A core principle behind coaching is that the
                            client who has the challenge will also have the solution - they just don't know it yet!</p>

            <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
                <div class="md:col-span-2 ">

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">What sort of issues can I bring to coaching?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">Coaching is helpful for all sorts of things. Examples include change in career,
                        change in life situation, promotion at work, personal relationships, how to be more productive
                        or achieving a specific goal.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">How many sessions will I need?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">This depends on what you bring to each session and what your goals for coaching are.
                        Usually clients have between 2 and 6 sessions at a time.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">How often will we meet?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">This depends on your goals but usually between fortnightly or monthly.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Do I have to continue if I don't think coaching is for me after the first
                        session?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">Not at all. You decide how much coaching you want, there is no obligation.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Will I have to do homework?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">Not if you don't want to. Sometimes it can be helpful to undertake small exercises
                        between sessions or simply take time for reflection. I won't make you do anything that you don't
                        want to do. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">What is the difference between coaching and therapy/counselling?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">Therapy is focused on understanding the past and healing traumas. A coach helps you
                        to evaluate your current place and support you in going forwards. A coach empowers you to find
                        solutions yourself and create action plans. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Why is coaching a great investment?</h2>
                    <p class="p-4">Coaching supports your self-development and improvement, to help you feel your
                        best. When thinking about costs it can be helpful to think of other services you
                        spend money on e.g. personal trainer or physiotherapy. All these services
                        strengthen you to thrive and flourish.</p>
