            <h1 class="text-6xl p-4">Terms and Conditions</h1>

            <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Approach &amp; Agreement</h2>

            <p class="p-4">Coaching is partnership (defined as an alliance, not a legal business
                partnership)
                between the coach and the client in a thought-provoking and creative process that
                inspires the client to maximize personal and professional potential. It is designed to
                facilitate the development of personal, professional or business goals and to develop
                a plan for achieving those goals.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Coach-Client Relationship</h2>

            <p class="p-4">The coach agrees to maintain the ethics and standards of behaviour established by
                the International Coach Federation.</p>

            <p class="p-4">Coaching results are not guaranteed and can vary person to person. The client
                enters into coaching with the full understanding that they are responsible for creating
                their own results.</p>

            <p class="p-4">The client understands coaching is not therapy and does not substitute for therapy if needed,
                and does not prevent, cure, or treat any mental disorder or medical disease.</p>

            <p class="p-4">The coach or the client may terminate or discontinue the coaching relationship at any time,
                giving at least 10 days' notice.</p>

            <p class="p-4">Sessions to be confidential unless there is a discretionary need to break confidence
                due to significant safety or legal concerns.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Procedure</h2>

            <p class="p-4">The time of the coaching meetings and/or location will be determined by coach and
                client based on a mutually agreed upon time.</p>

            <p class="p-4">The 30 minute chemistry sessions are for new clients only.</p>

            <p class="p-4">The 30 minute chemistry sessions are conducted online.</p>

            <p class="p-4">The client is under no obligation to continue with paid coaching after the chemistry
                session.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Payment Terms</h2>

            <p class="p-4">Fees can be paid online by debit or credit card, or by PayPal.</p>

            <p class="p-4">Receipts are available, and where receipts are requested by the client, they will be
                sent by e-mail.</p>

            <p class="p-4">Fees are payable in advance of each coaching session unless otherwise agreed
                Where payment has not been received in advance of a coaching session I am not
                obliged to provide the session.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Rearranging Sessions</h2>

            <p class="p-4">If a client needs to rearrange a coaching session, they should provide at least 48
                hours' notice. No refunds will be given to clients for unused coaching sessions
                unless 48 hours' notice has been given. In exceptional circumstances I may need to
                rearrange a coaching session. In that instance I will also give the client 48 hours'
                notice where practical.</p>
