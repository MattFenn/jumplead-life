                <h1 class="text-6xl p-4">I'd like to begin<br> with a story....</h1>
            
                <p class="p-4"><span class="text-2xl">There was once a woman who was very capable, smart and witty, who knew she
                    had so much to offer the world. She was passionate about the arts, education and
                    justice. She knew she could make a difference somewhere and wanted to empower
                    people to reach their potential.</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="p-4">The irony was she really struggled to accept her own
                        potential... to truly believe in herself and her abilities. Years went by taking jobs and
                        striving to forge her career. She took many paths, sometimes retracing her steps,
                        stopping at a crossroads for a break, picking herself up and starting again. This
                        search took a number of years. Along the way were some great achievements. Yet
                        she still didn't feel the sense of greatness and triumph deep down within. Tired and
                        lethargic, the journey of life felt defeating.</p>

                    <q class="float-right text-3xl w-48 ml-10 mb-10">Over time the woman began to feel alive with confidence</q>

                <p class="p-4">Then something happened... this woman went to work in a new role. The job was
                    interesting. It brought together education, empowering others and making a
                    difference to peoples’ lives.... and the people she worked with were brilliant. The
                    most brilliant of all was her manager. This person saw the woman. Saw her
                    potential, believed in her and became her champion. Over time the woman became
                    alive with confidence. She took on more work with the true belief she could do it...
                    and she could do it well. People noticed her. She became an expert in her chosen
                    field. People asked her advice. All the while her manager continued to support her
                    and build her confidence.</p>
                <p class="p-4">How did the manager make such a huge difference to the woman’s life? Did they
                    have all the answers and keep feeding them to her? Did they take away things that
                    were too difficult and make the woman’s life easier? No, the manager coached the
                    woman in a very subtle way. They asked incisive questions when the woman was
                    at a crossroads; they encouraged the woman to explore her drivers and motivations,
                    to identify her strengths and recognise her achievements for herself. The manager
                    helped the woman to understand her limiting beliefs and vanquish them.</p>
                <p class="p-4">The woman’s manager was a coach and used coaching skills to manage the team.</p>
                <p class="p-4">I am that woman. I understand the power of coaching and how it can change lives. I
                    have now trained as a professional coach and I want to share the transformational
                    wonder of coaching with you. You can be your best self and make changes... and
                    you have the ability to do so within you already.</p>

                        recently working in student support services in higher education. Along the way I
                        have volunteered with education charities and with community projects, sharing my
                        skills and learning new ones. I am passionate about life-long learning and

                        <p class="p-4 text-indigo-50"">My experience of working in different businesses across all sectors shows that we
                        don't just live life on one path. We can change and adapt, taking ourselves to new

My style is very much based on a 'Thinking Partner' model, allowing clients the space and time to explore their own thoughts. This way of working provides the opportunity to explore deeply held beliefs and values, including those that can limit our potential.

                            <p class="p-4">Coaching is the process of helping you identify and overcome your personal and professional challenges and achieve your desired outcomes. A coach will use deep listening, some questions and short exercises to help you realise and overcome your barriers.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p-4">A coach is a thinking partner, who won't provide solutions but enable you to explore possible solutions or paths yourself. A core principle behind coaching is that the client who has the challenge will also have the solution - they just don't know it yet!</p>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">What sort of issues can I bring to coaching?</h2>
                        <p>Coaching is helpful for all sorts of things. Examples include change in career, change in life situation, promotion at work, personal relationships, how to be more productive or achieving a specific goal.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">How many sessions will I need?</h2>
                        <p>This depends on what you bring to each session and what your goals for coaching are. Usually clients have between 2 and 6 sessions at a time.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">How often will we meet?</h2>
                        <p>This depends on your goals but usually between fortnightly or monthly.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Do I have to continue if I don't think coaching is for me after the first session?</h2>
                        <p>Not at all. You decide how much coaching you want, there is no obligation.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Will I have to do homework?</h2>
                        <p>Not if you don't want to. Sometimes it can be helpful to undertake small exercises between sessions or simply take time for reflection. I won't make you do anything that you don't want to do. </p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">What is the difference between coaching and therapy/counselling?</h2>
                        <p>Therapy is focused on understanding the past and healing traumas. A coach helps you to evaluate your current place and support you in going forwards. A coach empowers you to find solutions yourself and create action plans. </p>

                        <br>

                        <h2 class="text-3xl p-4">Why does coaching seem so expensive?</h2>
                        <p>Coaching might seem expensive, but it can be helpful to think of other services you
                            spend money on e.g. personal trainer or physiotherapy. Coaching is a service for
                            self-development and improvement, to help you feel your best. </p>
